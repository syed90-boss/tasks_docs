envoy proxy:

manage network traffic 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benefits of Using Envoy Proxy:

Load Balancing – Distributes traffic evenly if there are multiple instances of a service.
Traffic Routing – Sends requests to the right service automatically.
Security – Can add authentication and encryption (TLS).
Observability – Provides logs and monitoring to track network issues.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Envoy Proxy is a smart middleman that manages communication between services inside a system (Service-to-Service communication).

Example of Envoy Proxy
Inside your online store, different services need to talk to each other:

frontend-service asks api-service for product data.

api-service talks to database-service to get information.

order-service communicates with payment-service.

Instead of services talking directly, Envoy handles everything:
Balances traffic if there are multiple copies of a service.
Adds security (e.g., encryption, authentication).
Provides monitoring for service-to-service communication.
