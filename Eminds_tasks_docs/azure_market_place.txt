Azure Marketplace:

	* Search for “Nextcloud”

	* found "Bitnami Nextcloud"

 	* It promised:

	     - Ubuntu Linux 

	     - Apache web server 

	     - PHP + MariaDB (handled for him!)

	     - And the magical software — Nextcloud 
 
        * hit “Create”.
   
        * Within minutes, the VM will be alive!
   
        * copy the public IP, opened it in the browser — and working! There was the very own cloud drive, just like Dropbox or Google Drive, but totally under our control.

	* we could:

	     - Upload and download files
             - Create users and share folders
             - Sync calendars and contacts
             - Even use the Nextcloud mobile app
